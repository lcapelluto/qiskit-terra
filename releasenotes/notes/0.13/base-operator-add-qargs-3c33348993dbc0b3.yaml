    The addition method of the ``BaseOperator`` class now accepts a ``qarg``
    kwarg to allow adding a smaller operator to a larger one assuming identities
    on the other subsystems (same as for ``qargs`` on
    :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.compose` and
    :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.dot` methods). This allows
    subsystem addition using the call method as with composition. This support is
    added to all BaseOperator subclasses (:class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.ScalarOp`,
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator`,
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.QuantumChannel`).

    For example:
    
    .. code-block::

      from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator, ScalarOp

      ZZ = Operator.from_label('ZZ')

      # Initialize empty Hamiltonian
      n_qubits = 10
      ham = ScalarOp(2 ** n_qubits, coeff=0)

      # Add 2-body nearest neighbour terms
      for j in range(n_qubits - 1):
          ham = ham + ZZ([j, j+1])
