features:
  - |
    A new method, :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.reshape`, has been added
    to the ``BaseOperator`` class that returns a shallow copy of an operator
    subclass with reshaped subsystem input or output dimensions. The combined
    dimensions of all subsystems must be the same as the original operator or
    an exception will be raised.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``BaseOperator`` class no longer has been updated so that addition,
    subtraction and scalar multiplication are no longer abstract methods. This
    means that they are no longer required to be implemented in subclasses if
    they are not supported. The base class will raise a ``NotImplementedError``
    when the methods are not defined.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``BaseOperator`` methods ``add``, ``subtract``, and ``multiply`` have
    been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use operators the
    Python operators ``+``, ``-``, and ``*`` to obtain the functionality
    provided by these deprecated methods.
