    Add ``plot_quantum_channel_city`` function to visualization module.
    This function visualize Chi-matrix given by arbitrary quantum channel object
    in a cityscape fashion, for example::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit import quantum_info as qi
        from qiskit.visualization import plot_process_city

        qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
        qc.cx(0, 1)

        plot_quantum_channel_city(qc)

    Add ``plot_quantum_channel_hinton`` function to visualization module.
    This function visualize Chi-matrix given by arbitrary quantum channel object
    as a Hinton diagram, for example::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit import quantum_info as qi
        from qiskit.visualization import plot_process_city

        qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
        qc.cx(0, 1)

        plot_quantum_channel_hinton(qc)
